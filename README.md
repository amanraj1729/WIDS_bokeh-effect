# WIDS_bokeh-effect
This project was from WIDS ( winter in data science) conducted by Analytics club IIT Bombay, In this project first we have to learn the techniques of Computer vision and neural networks (CNN) and then apply it to achieve the bokeh effect on the images.

<br> In this project I achieved these points: 
Applied image segmentation and OpenCV techniques to achieve high-quality bokeh effect on multiple images
Created a PyTorch-based classifier for handwritten digit recognition on MNIST dataset achieving 95 percent accuracy
Applied both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to build models for linear regression, logisticregression, and various classification tasks. Consistently achieved over 90 percent accuracy across all models
